Dataquest is a website designed to teach and practise Data Science. It is located at [this link](https://www.dataquest.io).

After each module, there is a Guided Project. The projects that I was capable of accomplishing are as follows:

**P02** - [Exploring Hacker News Posts](https://app.dataquest.io/m/356/guided-project%3A-exploring-hacker-news-posts/1/introduction)

In this guided project, I classified the dataset into two boxes. I also cleaned the dataset and used datetime in order to find out the hours that people commented the most.

**P03** - [Exploring Ebay Car Sale Data](https://app.dataquest.io/m/294/guided-project%3A-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data/1/introduction)

Using Pandas and NumPy libraries, I renamed the column names, check the value counts and decided to drop some of the columns with unnecessary/no information. Replaced the symbols in some columns (such as "$") and changed the data types into numerical types in order to be able to sort values or make mathematical operations on them. I also excluded some outlier values. I gained the ability to analyze the overall dataset and then deep dive into values and be able to narrow down the dataset into a meaningful way. 

**P04** - [Visualizing Earnings Based on College ](https://app.dataquest.io/m/146/guided-project%3A-visualizing-earnings-based-on-college-majors/1/introduction)

In the first visualizing project, I worked with a dataframe from [American Community Survey](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors) which contains the recent gradutes from 2010-2012 and their majors, salaries, etc. Firt I made sure that there are no rows with null values. I plotted some scatter plots in order to find out if there is a correlation between the rows, then I plotted some histogram charts to find the frequency of the values within the series object.
Overall the whole project, the grouped bar plot was the most informative plot in my opinion.

**P09** - [Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL](https://app.dataquest.io/m/257/guided-project%3A-analyzing-cia-factbook-data-using-sql)

In this first project of SQL, I analyzed the dataset that belongs to CIA's World Factbook. The dataset contains information such as the population, area, birth rate, death rate etc of the countries all over the world. I had the chance to use Jupyter Notebook for SQL for the first time and found out the most populated country, countries that have more water area than land area, I found outliers (such as a row for World, so I excluded this row for my queries). I practised nested queries.
