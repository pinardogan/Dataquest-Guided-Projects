Dataquest is a website designed to teach and practise Data Science. It is located at [this link](https://www.dataquest.io).

After each module, there is a Guided Project. The projects that I was capable of accomplishing are as follows:

**P02** - [Exploring Hacker News Posts](https://app.dataquest.io/m/356/guided-project%3A-exploring-hacker-news-posts/1/introduction)

In this guided project, I classified the dataset into two boxes. I also cleaned the dataset and used datetime in order to find out the hours that people commented the most.

**P03** - [Exploring Ebay Car Sale Data](https://app.dataquest.io/m/294/guided-project%3A-exploring-ebay-car-sales-data/1/introduction)

Using Pandas and NumPy libraries, I renamed the column names, check the value counts and decided to drop some of the columns with unnecessary/no information. Replaced the symbols in some columns (such as "$") and changed the data types into numerical types in order to be able to sort values or make mathematical operations on them. I also excluded some outlier values. I gained the ability to analyze the overall dataset and then deep dive into values and be able to narrow down the dataset into a meaningful way.
